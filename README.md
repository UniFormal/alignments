Collection of alignments between mathematical libraries started at Dagstuhl Seminar 23401 - Automated mathematics: integrating proofs, algorithms and data

The original seed for these files were alignments between online glossaries (Chicago notes, nLab, UG France and Hosgood's multilingual dictionary) produced by Lucy Horowitz (Chicago University) for the project MathGloss [https://github.com/MathGloss](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/database,) presented at CICM 2023 in Cambridge.

Upload alignment files in the following format:

* one text file per alignment set
* one line per concept
* whitespace-separated list of identifiers in each line (quoted if they contain whitespace)

The files concepts-lean.txt, concepts-nlab.txt, and concepts.txt have been copied from the directory mathgloss, so far.
