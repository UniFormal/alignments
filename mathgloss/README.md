This folder contains the alignments between online glossaries (Chicago notes, nLab, UG France and Hosgood's multilingual dictionary)
produced by Lucy Horowitz (Chicago University) for the project MathGloss 
https://github.com/MathGloss
presented at CICM 2023.

These alignments use WikiData identifiers (Qxxxx) as targets of linguistic mappings.

The file algebra-smglom.txt simply maps terms from sTex into WikiData concepts, using   
Jan-Christoph Klie's library "wikimapper", https://github.com/jcklie/wikimapper.
